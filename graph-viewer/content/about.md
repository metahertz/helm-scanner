## About the author

The creator and author of Verummeum is Philip Vissenaekens, a software developer with an interest in open source and Linux. In 2018, Philip decided to move over completely to Linux. He had been running both Windows and Linux in a dual boot setup for a very long time, and he had tested a number of different Linux distributions during that time. Because it took Philip a long time to make his transition to Linux, he decided to create Verummeum to help others with their transition of using proprietary software to open source alternatives.
